# Simple Nodebot with JavaScript

This is the full code for the Simple Nodebot for the JavaScript with Hardware. This includes the code for Arduino, a simple web interface, and a node server. If you're stuck with the code, feel free to use as a reference!

## Installation

To install dependencies, simple install via NPM.

```
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can use Yarn. I personally prefer Yarn.

```
yarn install
```

## Commands and Scripts

This Nodebot has a set of scripts for development and production uses. Simply use `node` or `yarn` to run them.

* `start` — Starts the development server on port 8000 using `babel-node`.
* `dev` — Starts Webpack and watches for changes in `browser.js`.
* `build` — Makes a compiled copy of the browser and server code.
* `test` — Tests all scripts using ESLint and Flow. (Note: uses Yarn to run command).
* `production` — Runs the compiled server code.
